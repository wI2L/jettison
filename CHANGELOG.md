# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

**THIS LIBRARY IS STILL IN ALPHA AND THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES REGARDING API STABILITY YET**

## [v0.7.3] - 2021-11-02
- Fix the encoding of zero-value time.Duration type in string format.

## [v0.7.2] - 2021-08-31
- Minor performances improvements (remove inlined functions in `appendEscapedBytes`).

## [v0.7.1] - 2020-03-03
- Fix a regression in the marshaling of `nil` map keys that implement the `encoding.TextMarshaler` interface, intoduced during refactor in version [**v0.5.0**](https://github.com/wI2L/jettison/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0).
- Split `TestTextMarshalerMapKey` and `TestNilMarshaler` tests with build constraints to allow previously ignored cases to run with Go1.14.

## [v0.7.0] - 2020-02-17
- Add the `omitnil` field tag's option, which specifies that a field with a nil pointer should be omitted from the encoding. This option has precedence over the `omitempty` option. See this issue for more informations about the original proposal: [#22480](https://golang.org/issue/22480).

## [v0.6.0] - 2020-02-14
- Add support for the `sync.Map` type. The marshaling behavior for this type is similar to the one of the Go `map`.

## [v0.5.0] - 2020-02-02
#### Refactor of the entire project.
This includes the following changes, but not limited to:

- Remove the `Encoder` type to simplify the usage of the library and stick more closely to the design of `encoding/json`
- Reduce the number of closures used. This improves readability of stacktraces and performance profiles.
- Improve the marshaling performances of many types.
- Add support for marshaling `json.RawMessage` values.
- Add new options `DenyList`, `NoNumberValidation`, `NoCompact`, and rename some others.
- Replace the `Marshaler` and `MarshalerCtx` interfaces by `AppendMarshaler` and `AppendMarshalerCtx` to follow the new *append* model. See this issue for more details: [#34701](https://golang.org/issue/34701).
- Remove the `IntegerBase` option, which didn't worked properly with the `string` JSON tag.

> Some of the improvements have been inspired by the **github.com/segmentio/encoding** project.

## [v0.4.1] - 2019-10-23
- Fix unsafe misuses reported by go vet and the new `-d=checkptr` cmd/compile flag introduced in the Go1.14 development tree by *Matthew Dempsky*. The issues were mostly related to invalid arithmetic operations and dereferences.
- Fix map key types precedence order during marshaling. Keys of any string type are used directly instead of the `MarshalText` method, if the types also implement the `encoding.TextMarshaler` interface.

## [v0.4.0] - 2019-10-18
- Add the `Marshaler` interface. Types that implements it can write a JSON representation of themselves to a `Writer` directly, to avoid having to allocate a buffer as they would usually do when using the `json.Marshaler` interface.

## [v0.3.1] - 2019-10-09
- Fix HTML characters escaping in struct field names.
- Add examples for Marshal, MarshalTo and Encoder's Encode.
- Refactor string encoding to be compliant with `encoding/json`.

## [v0.3.0] - 2019-09-23
- Add global functions `Marshal`, `MarshalTo` and `Register`.
- Update `README.md`: usage, examples and benchmarks.

## [v0.2.1] - 2019-09-10
- Refactor instructions for types implementing the `json.Marshaler` and `encoding.TextMarshaler` interfaces.
   - Fix encoding of `nil` instances.
   - Fix behavior for pointer and non-pointer receivers, to comply with `encoding/json`.
- Fix bug that prevents tagged fields to dominate untagged fields.
- Add support for anonymous struct pointer fields.
- Improve tests coverage of `encoder.go`.
- Add test cases for unexported non-embedded struct fields.

## [v0.2.0] - 2019-09-01
- Add support for `json.Number`.
- Update `README.md` to add a Go1.12+ requirement notice.

## [v0.1.0] - 2019-08-30
Initial realease.
